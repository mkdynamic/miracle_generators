Description:
    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
    views. The resource is ready to use as a starting point for your restful,
    resource-oriented application. Tests are also generated.

    NB. Require formtastic, and generates formtastic code. Also requires a 
    helper method "heading" for capturing/displaying titles for views.
    
Usage:
    Pass the name of the model, either CamelCased or under_scored, as the first
    argument, and an optional list of attribute pairs.

    IMPORTANT: If no attribute pairs are specified, no model will be generated.
    It will try to determine the attributes from an existing model.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    For example, `miracle_scaffold post name:string content:text hidden:boolean`
    gives you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an index that lists them all, as well as a map.resources :posts
    declaration in config/routes.rb.
    
    If you pass --skip-tests=true, the tests will be omitted.

Examples:
    script/generate miracle_scaffold post

        Will create a restful controller called "posts" along with the views. 
        A model will NOT be created, instead it will look for an existing 
        model and use those attributes.

    script/generate miracle_scaffold post name:string content:text

        Will create a Post model and migration file with the name and content
        attributes. It will also create a restful controller with views.
